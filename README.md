# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

- Add additional animations (such as using the pulsating circle in the "About" section throughout the entire website in various positions, sizes, and colors). This would make the site look more cohesive and interesting.
- Add more color accents (in a color that is complementary to the dark blue used throughout).
- Add more photos of the products (possibly on the "Menu" page -- choosing a few "featured items").
